# Tetris

A simple Tetris implementation with a graphical interface built using Tkinter.

## Running the game

```bash
python tetris.py
```

Controls:
- Arrow keys: move and rotate pieces
- Space: drop piece instantly

## Tests

The core game logic is separated from the interface and can be tested without a display:

```bash
pytest
```
